BQAT is biometric quality assessment tool for generating and analysing biometric sample quality to international standards and supporting customized metrics.

> Note: This is the core component of `BQAT` that wraps the biometrics analysis functionalities as a `Python` module as a dependency which would not function as a standalone package.
